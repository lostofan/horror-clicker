# About project:

I like to watch horror movies with my friends (especially slasher). Recently, I came up with the idea to make a game of the "cookie clicker" type. 
Sooo this project is inspired by films of this genre.

# Made with
* React
* Redux Toolkit
* Sass
* Typescript

# Controls
* Killers adding kills to counter every second.
* Weapons make your click more expensive.
* Options:
  1. First param is multiplier of your click
  2. Add 100 clicks
  3. Clear your local storage and reset game
* Your progress is saving in local storage.
